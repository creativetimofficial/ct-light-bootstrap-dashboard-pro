**[Light Bootstrap Dashboard PRO](http://demos.creative-tim.com/light-bootstrap-dashboard-pro/examples/dashboard.html)** is a Bootstrap 4 Admin Theme designed to look simple and beautiful. Forget about boring dashboards and grab yourself a copy to kickstart new project! It is the easiest way to save time and money for your development.
What it is
Light Bootstrap Dashboard is built over Bootstrap 4 and it comes integrated with a large number of third-party apps redesigned to fit in with the rest of the elements.

If you want to see the basic version of the dashboard, please check out this link. You can download it for free and play around to see if you like the look and feel of it.

This product came as a result of users asking for more functionality than the basic version. We developed it based your feedback and apps you are building. It is very powerful tool, that will allow you to build products ranging to admin panels to content managements systems.
What it isn't
The Light Bootstrap Dashboard PRO is not a bloated-up bundle full with stuff you don't need. We actually take pride in the amount the stuff we didn't add to it. You will only find the stuff that you actually use in this product. No 8-levels navigation nobody uses, no irrelevant boxed layout, no drag and drop for cards(seriously, who goes around moving the display of his panel everyday?).

This dashboard is not something that you will grab and maybe use at some point. It is not a boring old tool and it is probably not what you already have in your project. It is the key to developing your next product.


It comes with 6 filter colors for the sidebar (`black`, `azure`,`green`,`orange`,`red`,`purple`) and an option to have a background image.
